# Open To-do API

A basic To-do List application that can be accessed through the command line or via web browser.

The API is built around three core models: 

* a **User** model
* a **List** model
* an **Item** model

It must return formatted responses that users can read, and machines can generate and parse. This application utilizes **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation).

For a more in-depth overview, see [the Project file](PROJECT.md).
