# Open ToDo API Project Notes

The Open ToDo API is an externally usable API for a basic to-do list application. This API will allow users to modify user accounts and to-do items from the command line. This project is an assignment from the [Bloc](http://bloc.io) Full Stack Web Developer track. The inspiration for this project is an application called [Todo.txt](http://todotxt.com/), which can be purchased for iOS and Android devices and includes a CLI (command line interface).

This API should allow a user to change the same data from the command line or the browser.
